SVM

Kernel Trick

10 featues and use a 5 degree polynomial kernel

10 + 5 / 5 = 3003



2 types of kernel

- 2 ways to map data into higher dimensional space that are commonly used with support vector machines:

Polynomial kernel

RBG kernel


SVM maximize margin

Hard margin, higher chance of overfitting

Soft margin, allowing ambiguity,

C = adjust margins, higher value = harder margin

Gamma = Sigma, lower gamma = sigma less. Wider distribution or not. 
Effective sample effect to neighbours = increase distribution.

RGB - 

High C - higher emphasis on errors.

- Higher C - More squiggly margin line. Trying to Split the data points PERFECTLY

Gamma - high gamma, reduce radius.  Spread of each data spread more. Border and margin being affected.

- Higher Gamma - Much more higher effect on complicating the higher plane right away
	




q. Polynomial kernel -  C (regularization) Amount of error allowed during learning process **CONSTANT BIAS** Kernel trick, degree  (can control how many dimensions up you go)

Cant control the amount of dimensions up you can go in RBG Kernel (Infinite) **
